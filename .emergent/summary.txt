The AI engineer's work on the ConnectVault CRM has progressed from an initial MVP to a more feature-rich application. Key challenges included a persistent frontend authentication issue, which was rigorously debugged and resolved by correcting React Router navigation and state management in . Significant effort was dedicated to UI/UX, aligning the application with a cream/navy/gold branding, refining component styling, and ensuring responsiveness. Feature development focused on the Marketing Vault (adding content, and then comprehensive import/export/CRUD for email swipes) and integrating Brevo email marketing, with preparations for Systeme.io. The previous engineer consistently prioritized user feedback, iteratively refining features like the dashboard greeting, header layout, and Quick Access links. The current task involves building a complete Commissions module, and the engineer has just begun by identifying relevant dashboard components.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture, featuring a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.



-   ****: This file defines the core API endpoints for authentication (register, login, forgot/reset password), dashboard summary, and Brevo email service. It handles MongoDB interactions and JWT. It has been updated to support Brevo API and secure settings storage. Future changes will include the Commissions module API.
-   ****: This JSON file stores seed data for Marketing Vault content, including email swipes, hooks, and prompts. It ensures initial data availability and is updated with new content, then copied to the frontend's  directory.
-   ****: The primary React application file. It manages routing,  for user authentication, and integrates all major page components (Login, Register, Dashboard, Contacts, Promo Links, Tasks, Marketing Vault, Settings, Email).
    -   **Auth Fixes**: Refactored  to correctly set user state,  component to use  for routing, and  to validate both token and user state.
    -   **UI/Branding**: Contains the  component (now using ), logic for dashboard layout, personalized greetings, and Quick Access strip.
    -   **Features**: Implements basic Promo Links, Add Task modal, Marketing Vault functionality (upload, edit, delete, export), Settings for API keys (Brevo, Systeme.io), and the Email sending page.
    -   It will be extensively modified to integrate the new Commissions module's UI, routing, and state management.
-   ****: Contains global CSS and custom Tailwind classes. Essential for applying the application's branding (cream background, navy accents, gold highlights), button styles, rounded corners, shadows, and ensuring responsive design. It has been refined for UI/UX polish.
-   ****: The application's logo, converted from SVG to PNG to resolve rendering issues. It's referenced in  for display on login and dashboard headers.
-   ****: A copy of the backend seed data, enabling the frontend to access and display Marketing Vault content.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on a significant feature: the creation of a comprehensive **Commissions module**. This module is intended to provide marketers with tools to manage their earnings.

The user's detailed request for the Commissions module (Chat Message 368) included:
1.  **Routing and Navigation:** Establishing a dedicated  route, ensuring the Dashboard's Commission Summary card and the top navigation tab both direct to this new page, and adding a Back to Dashboard button.
2.  **Data Model:** Defining a  MongoDB collection with fields such as uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),  (for multi-user support), , ,  (Pending, Unpaid, Paid), , , , , , and .
3.  **User Interface ():** Designing the UI with a header, Add Commission, Import CSV, and Export CSV buttons. Implementing filtering options (Status, Date range, Search), a summary bar for Paid/Unpaid/Pending totals, a paginated table with sortable columns and CRUD actions, an Add/Edit modal with date pickers and promo link selection, and a toggleable Calendar View.
4.  **Dashboard Card Integration:** Updating the existing Commission Summary card on the Dashboard to compute totals from the new commissions collection and navigate to  when clicked.
5.  **Access Control:** Ensuring all commissions queries filter data by the current user's ID.
6.  **Styling and Responsiveness:** Adhering to the existing ConnectVault theme (cream background, navy headers, soft shadows, rounded corners, pill buttons) and ensuring mobile-friendly layouts.
7.  **Testing Requirements:** Seeding sample data for verification of routing, totals, CRUD operations, and CSV import/export.

The engineer's last explicit action (Chat Message 375) was to read  specifically to locate the existing Commission Summary card. This indicates the initial step in integrating the new Commissions module into the frontend's routing and updating the dashboard's component. The task is in its very early stages, with the focus currently on setting up the routing and dashboard interaction.
