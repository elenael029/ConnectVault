The previous AI engineer has been working on building the ConnectVault CRM application from scratch. The primary focus has been on implementing core features: Authentication (Create Account, Login, Forgot/Reset Password) and the Dashboard. The AI engineer has also iteratively worked on UI/UX enhancements, including branding, color schemes, button styling, and layout, often in response to user feedback regarding visual inconsistencies or non-functional elements. A significant recurring challenge throughout the trajectory has been the persistent frontend authentication issue, where users are repeatedly redirected to the login page despite successful backend API calls. The UI updates also frequently failed to reflect immediately, requiring multiple rebuilds and restarts. Towards the end of the trajectory, a comprehensive set of new features was requested, including Quick Access shortcuts, a Settings page (with branding, quick access link management, and Brevo email integration), and an Email page for subscriber management. The AI engineer has just begun implementing these latest, extensive changes, with the last action being the refinement of dashboard tile CSS.

4.  **Offers & Commissions:** Renamed to Promo Links throughout. Placeholder for Add offers (Offer Name, Promo Link), Copy Link buttons. Placeholder for Log commissions ({ customer\_name, customer\_email, commission\_amount, date, paid\_checkbox }), summary, and CSV export.
5.  **Tasks:** Placeholder for Kanban board (Pending, In Progress, Done) with drag-and-drop (React Beautiful DnD). Auto-generated follow-up tasks.
6.  **Notifications:** Bell icon in header for alerts (Tasks due, New commission, Weekly unpaid summary). In-app toast notifications.
7.  **Marketing Vault:** Three tabs (Swipe Vault, Hook Vault, Prompt Vault) with preloaded examples (including 10 new email swipes). Copy-to-Clipboard, add/edit/delete, import/export via CSV.

    *   Quick Access row with pill buttons (ChatGPT, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest).
9.  **Email Integration (Brevo):** Settings page for API key management,  backend endpoint, frontend form for adding subscribers. Send Test Email functionality.
10. **General:** Mobile-friendly, responsive design. Disable buttons during requests. Clear error messages. GET /health endpoint.

**Pending/Known Issues:**
*   Persistent frontend authentication issues preventing navigation to the dashboard after successful login via UI.
*   UI rendering issues where visual changes are not consistently reflected despite code updates, requiring aggressive cache clearing/rebuilds.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Application:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless session management, Bcrypt for password hashing.
-   **UI/UX:** Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, Class Variance Authority (CVA) for UI component variants.
-   **Routing:** React Router DOM for frontend navigation.
-   **State Management/API Calls:** Axios for HTTP requests.
-   **Database Interaction:** PyMongo and Motor (async driver) for MongoDB.
-   **Validation:** Pydantic and Zod for data validation.
-   **Email Integration:** Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) transactional email API.
-   **Drag-and-Drop:** React Beautiful DnD (intended, but not yet fully implemented in trajectory).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for user authentication (register, login, forgot/reset password), dashboard summary, and the newly integrated Brevo email service (for sending test emails and managing API keys). It also handles database interactions with MongoDB and JWT token generation/validation. This file has been extensively modified for new routes and logic, including Brevo API integration and secure settings storage.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: This is the main React application file. It contains the primary routing setup using , the  for managing user authentication state and JWT tokens, and all the main page components (Login, Register, Dashboard, Contacts, Promo Links, Tasks, Marketing Vault, Settings, Email). It includes logic for API calls, form handling, and displays UI elements using Shadcn components and custom Tailwind CSS classes. This file has seen the most significant number of edits, receiving new pages, button handlers, branding logic, and API integrations. It also holds the in-memory state for Marketing Vault content and Quick Access links (prior to full Settings page integration).
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: This file contains the global CSS and custom Tailwind classes, crucial for applying the ConnectVault branding, color schemes (navy, gold, cream), button styles, shadows, and responsive design rules. It has been updated multiple times to reflect new color palettes and styling requirements.
-   **/app/frontend/public/logo.svg**: A new file added to store the application logo, to be used in headers and login pages.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Stores  which the frontend uses to communicate with the backend.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Stores  and  (now conceptually ).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation and verification of the frontend login functionality to consistently navigate to the dashboard after successful authentication.
-   Complete implementation of the Quick Access strip on the dashboard, reading links from the Settings store.
-   Finalizing the Settings page UI and backend wiring for Branding (App Name, Logo upload), Quick Access Links, and Brevo Email Integration (API Key storage, Send Test Email functionality).
-   Developing the Email page for adding subscribers via Brevo.
-   Adding the Email via Brevo button to Contact detail pages.
-   Implementing the full CRUD functionality for Contacts, Offers (Promo Links), Tasks, and Marketing Vault entries beyond initial placeholders.
-   Implementing CSV export for commissions and Marketing Vault entries.
-   Finalizing drag-and-drop for Tasks Kanban board.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was in the process of implementing a comprehensive set of updates requested by the user in Chat Message 319. This includes:

1.  **Branding & UI Theme:** Applying a global cream background (), updating primary navy () and accent gold () colors, ensuring consistent typography, rounded corners, soft shadows, and proper header branding (logo + ConnectVault).
2.  **Dashboard Quick Access:** Adding a Quick Access row with pill buttons for external links (ChatGPT, Instagram, TikTok, etc.).
3.  **Navigation & Label Fix:** Renaming all instances of Offers to Promo Links across UI, routes, and components.
4.  **Auth & Login Verification:** Addressing the persistent frontend authentication issues.
5.  **Brevo Email Marketing Integration:** Setting up a Settings page with an Email Marketing card for Brevo API key input and Send Test Email functionality. This involves backend endpoints (, , ) and frontend wiring.
6.  **Button Coloring:** Ensuring Contacts and Tasks buttons are navy, while Promo Links and Marketing Vault buttons are gold, with appropriate hover effects.

The engineer downloaded the , updated  with new theme and colors, updated  for Brevo integration, and made extensive edits to  to incorporate the new features, branding logic, and quick access. A specific issue with the  component's branding was fixed. The last action performed was to add specific CSS for the dashboard tiles, indicating ongoing styling refinement. The recurring login authentication issue, which prevents users from reaching the dashboard via the UI, remains a critical unresolved problem, despite multiple attempts to fix it.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify that the CSS for dashboard tiles has been correctly applied and is visible on the dashboard, and then continue debugging the persistent frontend authentication flow issue.
